# What is this project?
This (unfinished) project is the beginning of a lightweight symbolic mathematics library in Rust. In multiple other projects I've taken on, I've had the need to solve expressions of the form "`c1+x/c2=c3`". This project will eventually cover that use case.

It leverages Rust's comparatively strong type system to create type-safe expressions, and its memory management model for raw speed.

As of right now, the library is simply in development, with features being added as **personally** needed. Nothing important should ever rely on it in its current state.
